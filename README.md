# stack.js â€” aendrew's fork

A presentation library with intuitive, scroll-based navigation.

## What's different in this fork?

Given there's not been a lot of movement on Mike's side of Stack for awhile, I've
done a feature fork that I'll maintain at aendrew/stack. In this:

+ Bower support
+ AMD module loading
+ Grunt support
+ More options
+ Mobile support
